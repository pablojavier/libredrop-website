# Privacy Policy

**Last updated: {{ 'now' | date: "%B %d, %Y" }}**

## Our Privacy Promise

LibreDrop is built with privacy-by-design principles. This isn't just marketing speak ‚Äì it's fundamental to how the application works.

## The Simple Version

**We collect ZERO data about you.** Period.

LibreDrop doesn't collect, store, transmit, or analyze any personal information, usage data, analytics, or telemetry. Your files stay on your devices and your local network.

## The Detailed Version

### Data Collection: None

LibreDrop does not collect:
- ‚ùå Personal information (names, emails, phone numbers)
- ‚ùå Usage analytics or telemetry
- ‚ùå File contents, names, or metadata
- ‚ùå Device information or identifiers
- ‚ùå Network information beyond local discovery
- ‚ùå Location data
- ‚ùå Crash reports (unless manually sent)

### How File Transfers Work

1. **Local Network Only**: Files are transferred directly between devices on your local Wi-Fi network
2. **No Cloud Storage**: Files never touch our servers or any cloud service
3. **No Internet Required**: Transfers work without internet connectivity
4. **Temporary Connections**: Devices connect only during active transfers
5. **No Logging**: Transfer activities are not logged or recorded

### Data We Cannot Access

Because LibreDrop works locally:
- We cannot see what files you transfer
- We cannot see who you transfer files to
- We cannot see when you use the application
- We cannot see your device information
- We cannot access your local network

### Third-Party Services

LibreDrop does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.

### Website Analytics

This website (libredrop.org) does not use Google Analytics, tracking cookies, or any analytics services. We may review server logs for security purposes only.

### Open Source Transparency

LibreDrop is open source software. You can:
- [Review the complete source code]({{ site.repository }})
- Verify our privacy claims yourself
- Build the application from source
- Contribute improvements to privacy and security

### Changes to Privacy Policy

We will never change our core privacy commitment. Any updates to this policy will only clarify existing practices or add additional privacy protections.
